# VEAL
VEAL is a younger leaner take on BeEF. 

VEAL uses Node/Express server-side, with Angular on the client-side.

Hooked browsers' sessions are based around the use of WebSockets instead of requests on an interval.

Run npm install and bower install to install dependencies

Run npm start to start the server
